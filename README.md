# CAMBAI-Hackathon
This repo contains the project made for the CAMB AI x CodersHQ hackathon. 
Segments of the project:
* GPEC
* Story Telling 

## GPEC
  
The main objective of the the GPEC was to allow the user to record a video of them speaking in a language and using the CAMB AI the video could be dubbed to any language of their desire.

`AVrecordeR.py` : This file contains the code for recording video and audio combining it into one. This was branched from https://github.com/bunkahle/AVrecordeR 

`run.py` : This file is used to run the AVrecoderR file.

`uploading.py` : Script to upload videos to catbox and get a link for it.

`dub.py` : Script used to access the api key and dub the video.

`sending_mail.py` : Script to send email to the user using SMTP.

`frontend.py` : Script to pipeline all the process (GUI still in development).

#### Note: Replicating this code would require you to purchase CAMB AI api for TTS, Dubbing etc.
